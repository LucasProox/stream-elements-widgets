# Pop-Up Chat
Chat messages appear in a random location on screen!

## Features
- Customizable **sound effect** when a chat message appears
- **User's name color** is used to color the message (with pretty backup colors if they don't have one chosen)
- **Fancy animations** for when a message appears and disappears
- Customizable **padding bounds** (number of pixels from the edges that messages won't overlap into)
- **Animated rainbow** effect for **highlighted messages**
- Immediately removes **deleted messages**
- Adjustable **message lifetime** and **delay** before a message is visible
  - Delay gives mods a bit of time to delete unwanted messages before they are shown on stream
  - A minimum delay of 1 second is also necessary for position and size calculations
